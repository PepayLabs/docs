# Pepay: The Payment Layer for Autonomous Agents

*The Missing Piece of the AI Agent Stack*

**Built by the team at $PepeRuney**

---

## The Crypto AI Agent Stack 🔌

**Brains**: LLMs (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Claude)  
**Bodies**: Frameworks (ai16z, 8n8, Virtuals)  
**Tools**: Trading (GOAT), **Payments (Pepay)**

**Pepay is the missing piece** — the protocol enabling AI agents to *transact value* as seamlessly as they process language.

---

## The Problem

**AI agents are stuck in a financial straitjacket.** They can process data, write code, and even crack jokes — but when it comes to *paying for pizza* 🍕 (ask ai16z), they're helpless. Today's payment rails are **custodial, fragmented, and AI/Crypto-illiterate**. With 1B AI agents projected by 2026 (Gartner), today's payment rails are custodial, fragmented, and AI-illiterate.

---

## The Solution

**Pepay is the first protocol letting AI agents *own* their economy.**

- 🤖 **Self-Custody Wallets**: Your AI keeps its own keys. *No middlemen, no memecoins wasted.*
- 🌐 **Multi-Chain Fluency**: Pay/accept BNB, SOL, ETH, BASE, etc. — **speaks to every chain** *for a polyglot future.*
- ⚡ **Autonomous Invoicing**: Time-bound, partial payments, fraud-proof tracking. *Set it and forget it.*
- 🔧 **Modular Design**: Swap chains, add features, or fork – no vendor lock-in.

---

## Why Pepay? (TL;DR)

- 🧠 **Completes the Stack**: LLMs think, frameworks act, **Pepay transacts**.
- 🚀 **Beyond AI**: Same protocol powers retail, social casinos, DeSci, and *any on-chain economy*.
- 🛠️ **For Builders**: Modular, open-source, and *actually permissionless*.

---

## How it Works (For the visionaries)

1. **AI Agent**: *"Need to invoice 0.5 ETH for this code review."* 💻
2. **Pepay**: Generates a self-custody invoice, sets a 24h expiry. ⏳
3. **Customer**: Pays via Phantom, Metamask, etc. *No KYC, no gaslighting.*
4. **AI Agent**: *"Payment settled. Initiating service."* 🚀

---

## Why This Matters

- **CZ's Vision, Executed**: AI + crypto isn't hype — it's *infrastructure*. Pepay's the proof.
- **Beyond Payments**: The protocol's modular design (Kubernetes, multi-chain) lets devs build *any* financial logic on top.
- **Peperuney Ecosystem**: Already live in our social casino 🎰 — *where memes meet monetization*.

## One-Liner for the Ages

> **"Pepay is the Stripe for AI agents, the Venmo for DAOs, and the SWIFT for crypto's autonomous future — all without the middlemen."**
