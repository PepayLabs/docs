# Key Features

Pepay was built to break the financial barriers holding back AI agents and on-chain economies. Here are the core features that set Pepay apart:

---

## Multi-Chain Model

Pepay supports multiple blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, BASE), allowing AI agents and merchants to transact in their preferred chain. This **polyglot** approach future-proofs Pepay against shifting market trends—adding new chains is as simple as plugging in a new module.

**Why it matters:**

- **Seamless Cross-Chain Payments**: Accept ETH, SOL, and beyond, all under one unified interface.
- **Future-Proof**: Easily adapt to emerging L2s or new blockchains without overhauling your payment logic.

---

## Self-Custody Architecture

Pepay is **non-custodial** by design, ensuring that merchants and AI agents maintain full control over their private keys. There are no third-party custodians—Pepay simply provides the payment rails. Merchants may use the KMS encrypted custodial wallets or operate with their own wallets

**Why it matters:**

- **Security & Ownership**: Your wallet, your keys. No middleman controlling your funds.
- **Trustless Transactions**: Reduce counterparty risk and remove friction in on-chain payments.

---

## Developer Testnet

Test new payment flows and integrations without risking real funds. Pepay offers a **dedicated testnet** environment to let you break things in a sandbox before going live.

**Why it matters:**

- **Safe Experimentation**: Build and iterate faster without incurring costly on-chain fees.
- **Frictionless Onboarding**: Lower the barrier to entry for developers looking to integrate Pepay into AI agent workflows or merchant platforms.

---

## Partial Payment System

Pepay's partial payment feature enables you to accept or send payments in increments, rather than settling an invoice in full.

**Why it matters:**

- **Flexible Billing**: Allow your customers or AI agents to pay as they go.
- **Improved Accessibility**: Smaller amounts lower the commitment threshold and widen your user base.

---

## Time-Bound Invoicing

Set an **expiry period** for each invoice, ensuring payments are made within a specific window. If the deadline passes, the invoice expires automatically.

**Why it matters:**

- **Fraud Prevention**: Close payment channels before bad actors exploit them.
- **Revenue Protection**: Keeps payment expectations clear for both AI agents and end users.

---

## Multi-Platform Support

Pepay integrates with popular communication tools and AI frameworks, making it easy to embed payments where conversations and collaborations happen.

**Building Support for:**

- **Multiple AI Agent Models** (AI16z, 8n8, PyDantic, ARC, Virtuals)
- **Discord, Twitter, Telegram** connectors
- **Document Ingestion & Retrieval**: Pepay integrates with AI workflows that require data ingestion and context retrieval for transactions or invoice generation. This could include emails, addresses, or customer information.

---

## Observability & Logging

Pepay provides logs, alerts, and health checks to ensure you have full visibility into your payment flows.

**Why it matters:**

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Quickly diagnose issues or failed transactions.
- **Scalability**: Track metrics as your user base or number of AI agents grows.

---

## Putting It All Together

Pepay doesn't just handle payments; it **empowers** AI agents, merchants, and users to transact seamlessly in an evolving multi-chain world. Whether you're building an autonomous AI service, an on-chain social casino, or a retail crypto gateway, Pepay's flexible, non-custodial, and developer-friendly architecture has you covered.
