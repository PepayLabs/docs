# Technologies & Architecture of PePay

## Technologies Used in PePay

PePay leverages a modern stack to ensure security, scalability, and performance for seamless cryptocurrency payment processing. Here's an overview of the core technologies:

### 1. Backend Technologies

* **Node.js**: A lightweight, high-performance runtime for handling asynchronous operations and building scalable APIs.
* **Express.js**: Simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs to serve the backend.
* **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database for storing user data, invoices, and transactions.
* **GraphQL (Optional)**: Enables flexible and efficient querying for complex use cases.
* **Webhooks**: Provides real-time updates to merchants for payment and invoice events.

### 2. Blockchain Integration

* **Ethereum (EVM-compatible chains)**: Supports Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, and Arbitrum.
* **Solana**: Offers fast and low-cost transactions.
* **Token Management**: Handles various tokens like ETH, SOL, and USDC.

### 3. Front-End & Dashboard

* **React.js**: Powers the merchant dashboards for an intuitive user interface.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Provides responsive and visually appealing design.
* **Iframe Embed**: For seamless integration of payment interfaces.

### 4. Payment Features

* **Live Exchange Rates**: Uses APIs like CoinGecko to fetch real-time token-to-USD conversion rates.
* **Automatic Token Conversion**: Converts crypto to stablecoins (e.g., USDC) based on merchant preferences.
* **Secure Transactions**: Validates and confirms payments using blockchain data.

### 5. Security

* **Encryption**: Protects sensitive data, including API keys and user information.
* **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of APIs by limiting requests.
* **Webhook Authentication**: Ensures the authenticity of notifications sent to merchants.
