# 🛣️ Pepay Protocol Roadmap

As the protocol reaches full production readiness, the following roadmap outlines the immediate next steps toward scaling adoption, ensuring system robustness, and expanding multi-chain coverage.

***

### 🔄 Phase: Transition to Full MainNet Availability

**Status: In Progress ✅**

The core payment infrastructure is live and operational across supported networks. The next focus is ensuring long-term reliability, secure settlement pipelines, and developer tooling for broader adoption.

#### ✅ MainNet Transition Milestones

* ✅ **Testnet/Mainnet Parity Achieved** — Unified RPC layer for cross-environment consistency
* 🚧 **99.9% Uptime SLA** — Moving toward enterprise-grade availability targets
* ◻️ **Increasing Settlement Robustnes - Making sure on failure cases automation in place to handle especially in dynamic swaps**
* ✅ **Audititable Settlement Pipeline** — Verifiable logs and dispute resolution architecture
* ◻️ **Mainnet Usage Analytics** — Volume, error rate, uptime, transaction speed monitoring

***

### 🔌 Phase: Agent SDK & Decentralized Marketplace 🚀

**Focus: Enable open discovery, self-service onboarding, and verifiable performance**

#### 🧱 Core Agent Layer (Planned)

* ◻️ **Agent SDK** — UI components & backend wrappers for agent integration
* ◻️ **Agent Discovery Protocol** — Public marketplace to browse by category, service, rating
* ◻️ **Agent service search**— Agent discovery. Agent availability, pricing, and verified performance metrics
* ◻️ **Performance Analytics** — Built-in dashboards for agents to track growth and reputation

This layer formalizes the **trustless agent economy** on top of your composable service/payment rails.

***

### 🔁 Phase: Ecosystem Hardening & Chain Expansion (Gen1 🔜)

**Focus: Infrastructure resilience and developer scalability**

#### ⚙️ Network Stability

* 🚧 **Multi-Network Support in RPC Layer** — Current testnet/mainnet shared architecture
* ◻️ **Gas Fee Optimization Engine** — Estimate & auto-adjust gas costs across chains
* ◻️ **Fiat Equivalent Stables optomisation** — Estimate & auto-adjust gas costs across chains

#### 🔗 New Chains & Protocols

* 🚧 **Avalanche (AVAX) Testnet Integration**
* ◻️ **Cross-Chain Transfer Routes** — Generalized asset routing logic
* ✅ **Token Expansion Framework** — Easily onboard new tokens with on-chain config, Built for solana, bnb, base, any evm&#x20;
  * add SUI APTO AND XRP&#x20;

#### 👨‍💻 Developer Tooling

* ✅ **User Onboarding Flow (Internal)**
* ◻️ **Python SDK**
* ◻️ **Admin Inventory Management Tools**
* ◻️ **Farcaster Frames Integration**
* 🚧 **Pydantic-Based Type Enforcement (Backend Stability)**
* ◻️ **Virtuals Integration for AI Agent Compatibility**

***

### 🌟 Gen2 – Yield & Protocol-Owned Liquidity (R\&D)

**Focus: Ecosystem value capture and decentralized capital flows**

Planned modules:

* ◻️ **Yield Layer for $USD1** — Protocol-native stablecoin yield strategy
* ◻️ **Liquidity Routing Vaults** — Custom routing for LP-backed yield products
* ◻️ **Settlement Buffer Contracts** — Hold-and-distribute contracts to absorb volatility
* ◻️ **On-Chain Fee Streams** — Trackable, redeemable protocol revenue in real time

***

### 🛒 E-Commerce Integrations

**Focus: Embedded crypto checkout across major site builders & open-source commerce platforms**

Your protocol is becoming plug-and-play across the most widely used CMS and commerce platforms. The goal: make it effortless for creators, merchants, and nonprofits to accept crypto payments on their own sites — no coding required.

#### ✅ Completed

* **WordPress Plugin** — Full Pepay integration via shortcode or widget
  * Drag-and-drop embed
  * Admin UI for connecting wallets & supported tokens
  * Auto-generation of invoices via WooCommerce hooks (optional)

#### 🚧 In Progress

* **Wix Plugin**
  * Web-based iframe drop-in
  * OAuth-based creator login with keyless connection
* **PrestaShop Integration**
  * Open-source module
  * Full crypto payment flow for merchants with zero custody

#### 🔜 Planned (Q3)

* **OpenCart**
* **Magento**
* **Ghost CMS**
* **Drupal Commerce**

These integrations will follow the same model:

* Non-custodial wallet setup (with optional escrow)
* Configurable tokens/networks per store
* Payment status webhooks and invoice tracking

#### ❌ Not Currently Supported

* **Shopify**
  * Due to API limitations on custom payment providers
  * Under evaluation pending future partnership/Shopify Plus support

***

**Why it matters:**\
This layer unlocks _massive real-world utility_—turning basic websites into crypto-native storefronts and donation portals with 5-minute installs. From WordPress bloggers to PrestaShop retailers, your protocol meets users where they are.

***

### 🧱 Ongoing Infrastructure Upgrades

* ◻️ **Continued Network Hardening** — Monitoring, rate limiting, cache isolation
* ◻️ **Settlement Failure Simulation** — Internal tooling to test protocol-wide settlement failure conditions
* ◻️ **Security Reviews** — Recurring internal + external audits (Q3 onwards)
* ◻️ **Token Whitelisting Portal** — Permissionless but verifiable token addition mechanism
* ◻️ **Multi-Region Redundancy** — Geo-distributed RPC + webhook system resilience

***

### 🔭 Summary



Next step: unlock developer velocity and liquidity loopbacks.

* ◻️ Unified Assets System
* ◻️ Multiple Off-Ramp APIs&#x20;
