### AI-Powered Pre-Sales & Product Launches

**Context**\
Brands and projects often host token or product pre-sales, with AI agents handling marketing, user sign-ups, and payment execution.

**Why Pepay?**

* **Early-Bird Access**: Offer exclusive, time-limited rates before a public launch using **time-bound invoices**.
* **Fully Managed**: Seek participants with agents create option to purchase tokens

**Example**\
An AI agent coordinates an NFT or product pre-sale, quickly onboarding customers through Pepay’s single iFrame workflow. Buyers secure their item with a partial deposit and finalize payment when the product is ready to ship or the NFT is minted.



***

### Decentralized Science (DeSci) Payments

**Context**\
Researchers and contributors share access to specialized datasets, lab simulations, or research findings on a decentralized network.

**Why Pepay?**

* **Microtransactions at Scale**: Pepay’s partial payment and multi-chain capabilities let researchers handle pay-per-use models effortlessly.
* **Time-Bound Invoicing**: Control data access windows by setting invoice expiries.

**Example**\
An AI agent querying a decentralized research portal seamlessly settles small payments (e.g., 0.01 ETH per data snippet) via Pepay before returning research insights to the user.

***

### AI-Enhanced Retail Purchases

**Context**\
AI shopping assistants compare product prices and manage orders across multiple blockchain-based marketplaces.

**Why Pepay?**

* **Cross-Chain Checkout**: Accept or pay with SOL, ETH, or any supported token.
* **Gather Customer Data:** Emails, preferences, feedback
* **Single iFrame Workflow**: Smooth user onboarding and checkout experience, all in one unified interface.

**Example**\
Your AI agent scouts the best deals on a Solana-based marketplace and completes checkout via Pepay—executing a partial or full payment, depending on user preferences.

***

### Gaming Ecosystems

**Context**\
AI-driven gaming platforms or metaverse environments allow users to purchase in-game assets, participate in tournaments, and manage microtransactions.

**Why Pepay?**

* **In-Game Currencies**: Supports multiple gaming tokens, bridging cross-chain ecosystems.
* **Partial Payments**: Players can buy assets or upgrades in increments, fueling engagement.

**Example**\
A blockchain game sells NFT skins, with the AI agent (or user) paying via Pepay. Users can opt for partial payments if they only want to put down a deposit initially.

***

### Subscription-Based AI Services

**Context**\
AI frameworks (e.g., AI16z, ARC) offer pay-as-you-go or monthly subscription tiers for advanced model access.

**Why Pepay?**

* **Real-Time Billing**: Charge users per second of compute or per API call, automatically recorded on-chain.
* **Self-Custody**: Service providers never hold user funds; Pepay ensures trustless payment flows.

**Example**\
An AI hosting service charges tokens per GPU hour used. When usage crosses a threshold, Pepay triggers a partial invoice, and the user’s wallet confirms payment.

***

### AI-Powered Marketplaces

**Context**\
Decentralized marketplaces for NFTs, digital goods, or intellectual property rely on AI agents to facilitate discovery and pricing.

**Why Pepay?**

* **Flexible Payment Options**: Multi-chain support for a wide range of cryptocurrencies.
* **Invoice Customization**: Time-bound or partial payments for big-ticket or auctioned items.

**Example**\
An AI agent acting as an NFT “negotiator” automatically finalizes deals on the user’s behalf, using Pepay for secure, non-custodial payments.

***

### On-Demand AI Training and Models

**Context**\
Companies and developers purchase training time or access to specialized AI models hosted on decentralized platforms.

**Why Pepay?**

* **Usage-Based Invoicing**: Pay only for actual training hours, with incremental or partial settlement.
* **Observability**: Monitor training-related costs in real time via Pepay’s logging and dashboards.

**Example**\
A biotech startup’s AI agent spins up a large language model training job on a decentralized HPC network, paying seamlessly in chunks whenever a milestone is reached.

***

**Context**\
AI agents track and optimize vendor contracts, shipping routes, and inventory levels across multiple global players.

**Why Pepay?**

* **Cross-Border Transactions**: Leverage Pepay to handle varying currencies and chain preferences.
